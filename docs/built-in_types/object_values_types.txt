Object, Values and Types

In python the objects are representation of data in abstract way, all the data in Python program is represented by 
objects or relations between objects.

Every object has an identity, a type and a values. An object's identity never change once it has been created.

For a comparation between two object's identity we have the 'is' operator. Now if you want to identify the the identity of 
an object in python we have the id() method which return a value integer.

    CPython implementation detail: For CPython, id(x) is the memory address where x is stored.
