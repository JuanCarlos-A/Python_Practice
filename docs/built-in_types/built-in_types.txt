Operators

Booleans o Logicos

There are three Booleans Operators, for example:
    x OR y : This is a short-cuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is False
    x AND y : This is a short-cuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is True
    NOT has a lower priority than non-Booleans Operators, so not a == b is interpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a sintax error.


Comparisons o Relacion

There are eight comparison operations in python. They all have the same priority, which is higher than that the boolean Operators. These are:
    < : Strictly less than
    <= : Less than or equal
    > : Strictly greater than
    >= : Greater than or equal
    == : Equal 
    != : Not equal
    is : Object identity
    is not : Negated object identity
Objects of different types, except different numeric types, never compare equal
